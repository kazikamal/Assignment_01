#Secret Key generation and check
##What is ES6
ES6, or ECMAScript 2015, is the 6th edition of the ECMAScript language specification standard. It was released in June 2015 and introduced significant new features and improvements to JavaScript, making it more powerful and easier to work with. Here are some of the key features introduced in ES6:

##Key Features of ES6
1. Arrow Functions:

Provide a shorter syntax for writing functions.
Lexically bind the this value.
javascript
Copy code
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
2. Classes:

Introduce a new syntax for creating objects and dealing with inheritance.
javascript
Copy code
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  }
}
3. Template Literals:

Allow embedding expressions inside string literals using backticks (`).
javascript
Copy code
const name = "World";
const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
4. Destructuring:

Allow extracting values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.
javascript
Copy code
// Array Destructuring
const [a, b] = [1, 2];

// Object Destructuring
const { name, age } = { name: "John", age: 30 };
5. Default Parameters:

Allow setting default values for function parameters.
javascript
Copy code
function multiply(a, b = 1) {
  return a * b;
}
6. Spread and Rest Operators:

Spread operator (...) expands an iterable (like an array) into individual elements.
Rest operator (...) collects multiple elements into an array.
javascript
Copy code
// Spread
const arr1 = [1, 2];
const arr2 = [...arr1, 3, 4];

// Rest
function sum(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
}
7. Let and Const:

let declares block-scoped variables.
const declares block-scoped constants.
javascript
Copy code
let x = 10;
const y = 20;
8. Promises:

Provide a way to handle asynchronous operations more easily.
javascript
Copy code
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // async operation
});

myPromise.then(result => {
  console.log(result);
}).catch(error => {
  console.error(error);
});
9. Modules:

Allow splitting code into separate files and importing/exporting functionality.
javascript
Copy code
// Exporting (module1.js)
export const myFunction = () => { /*...*/ };

// Importing (module2.js)
import { myFunction } from './module1.js';
10. Enhanced Object Literals:

Provide shorthand syntax for defining object properties and methods.
javascript
Copy code
const name = "John";
const person = {
  name,
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  }
};
These features and many more introduced in ES6 have greatly improved the functionality, readability, and maintainability of JavaScript code.

##Event Bubbling
Event Bubbling is a mechanism in JavaScript where an event propagates from the innermost element (the event target) outward to the outermost elements. This means when an event is triggered on an element, it first runs the handlers on that element, then on its parent element, then on the grandparent element, and so on, up to the document root.

##Event Delegation
Event Delegation is a technique in JavaScript where you use a single event listener on a parent element to manage events for multiple child elements. Instead of attaching separate event listeners to each child element, you attach one listener to a common ancestor, leveraging event bubbling to capture events on child elements.

This technique is efficient and helps in scenarios where child elements are dynamically added or removed.

##Combining Both Concepts
Event Delegation relies on Event Bubbling. By understanding event bubbling, you can effectively use event delegation to manage events more efficiently in your application, especially when dealing with a large number of elements or dynamically changing content.

##Local storage:
Local storage is the most recent mechanism. It allows for larger amounts of data to be stored, but the data is not deleted when the browser is closed. Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access later, such as offline data.

##Session storage:
Session storage is similar to cookies, but the data is only stored for the current session. This means that the data will be deleted when the user closes the browser. Session storage is useful for storing data that is sensitive, such as login credentials.

##Cookies:
Cookies are the oldest and most well-known mechanism. They are simple to use and well supported by browsers. However, they are limited to 4KB of data and are often used to store data that is not sensitive, such as user preferences.

##inline: Elements are placed next to each other without line breaks. Width and height properties are not respected.
##inline-block: Elements are placed next to each other without line breaks. Width and height properties are respected.
##block: Elements start on a new line and take up the full width available. Width and height properties are respected.
