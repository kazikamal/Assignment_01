#Secret Key generation and check
##What is ES6
ES6, or ECMAScript 2015, is the 6th edition of the ECMAScript language specification standard. It was released in June 2015 and introduced significant new features and improvements to JavaScript, making it more powerful and easier to work with. Here are some of the key features introduced in ES6:

##Key Features of ES6
1. Arrow Functions:

Provide a shorter syntax for writing functions.
Lexically bind the this value.
javascript
Copy code
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
2. Classes:

Introduce a new syntax for creating objects and dealing with inheritance.
javascript
Copy code
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  }
}
3. Template Literals:

Allow embedding expressions inside string literals using backticks (`).
javascript
Copy code
const name = "World";
const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
4. Destructuring:

Allow extracting values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.
javascript
Copy code
// Array Destructuring
const [a, b] = [1, 2];

// Object Destructuring
const { name, age } = { name: "John", age: 30 };
5. Default Parameters:

Allow setting default values for function parameters.
javascript
Copy code
function multiply(a, b = 1) {
  return a * b;
}
6. Spread and Rest Operators:

Spread operator (...) expands an iterable (like an array) into individual elements.
Rest operator (...) collects multiple elements into an array.
javascript
Copy code
// Spread
const arr1 = [1, 2];
const arr2 = [...arr1, 3, 4];

// Rest
function sum(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
}
7. Let and Const:

let declares block-scoped variables.
const declares block-scoped constants.
javascript
Copy code
let x = 10;
const y = 20;
8. Promises:

Provide a way to handle asynchronous operations more easily.
javascript
Copy code
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // async operation
});

myPromise.then(result => {
  console.log(result);
}).catch(error => {
  console.error(error);
});
9. Modules:

Allow splitting code into separate files and importing/exporting functionality.
javascript
Copy code
// Exporting (module1.js)
export const myFunction = () => { /*...*/ };

// Importing (module2.js)
import { myFunction } from './module1.js';
10. Enhanced Object Literals:

Provide shorthand syntax for defining object properties and methods.
javascript
Copy code
const name = "John";
const person = {
  name,
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  }
};
These features and many more introduced in ES6 have greatly improved the functionality, readability, and maintainability of JavaScript code.
